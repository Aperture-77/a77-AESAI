      'log00':`It's been quite a while since I've left the complex. Cave had ordered me to work overtime on the ASMOPT. He seems to be becoming increasingly paranoid that NASA is incredibly close to winning the space race and stealing his spotlight. I had to stay in the loading bay for 13 hours today, just observing that each and every piece is properly assembled as shown on the blueprints I designed. I'm not sure how he thinks harnessing a black hole in an underground facility is a good idea, but I can't find work anywhere else, and this pays well.`,
      'log01':`Things are looking slightly better. Aperture has just opened a new test shaft that showcases the use of the ASOMPT on a tiny, and more controlled scale. I've personally designed and checked every single tiny ASOMPT that Aperture has produced, and I can confidently say that they're as safe as they can be. The only downside to this being that this test shaft was extremely costly. I'm not sure where we're going to find the funding that will support the safety measures that we need for the large ASOMPT to be safe. `

    'dec_9_64.txt':`Due to recent events related to the Aperture Science [redacted] test shaft Kilo Franklin has been closed to the public and is not expected to return. Now, this begs the question: How do I access test shaft Kilo Franklin? The simple answer is to become an Astronaut. Starting on the new year Aperture Science will begin taking applications to test the [redacted]. Training and safety measures will be provided.

    'jan_21_65.txt':`Aperture Science is happy to announce that all spots on the application form have been taken! We currently have 12 enlisted astronauts, two of which are ready to test the [redacted]. Aperture Science would also like to address the concerns the public have over this experiment. Don't worry, the [redacted] has been tested and it works fine and is completely safe 50% of the time. That's a 25% increase since it was last opened to the public!`,
    'aug_19_69.txt':`Aperture Science regrets to report that the Aperture Science [redacted] experiment did not go as planned. This will result in the condemnation of test shaft Kilo Franklin and the 1960s branch of the facility. However, don't be alarmed, Aperture is doing just fine financially and will continue it's experiments in the coming years.`
